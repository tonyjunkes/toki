# Toki

An IRC chat bot for Twitch built on ClojureScript, Node and friends.

This is an experiment and learning process for diving into the world of IRC bots along with a deeper learning of Clojure(Script), Node and JavaScript as a whole. The bot is intended to be used primarily for @peeshadog on Twitch, but I figured it may have use for someone else who is interested too.

More info and how to use everything coming soon.
